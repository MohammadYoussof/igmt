Installation and configuration

To get iGMT running, extract the distribution igmt_v1.2.tar.gz
(or, alternatively, its slim version igmt_v1.2_wo.tar.gz) -if you have not
already done so- in a directory where you typically store Tcl/Tk
scripts. This could well be at the single user level on multi-user
systems (non-root priveliges installation) since the package itself is
relatively small. Installing multiple copies would allow every user to
modify the iGMT code themselves.

From here, you can either choose to use the script 
configure_script which we provide or proceed to do a few changes
manually. If you choose the "automatic" way, you will have to enter
the iGMT directory that you just created by expanding the tar-file and 
type 

./configure_script. 

After answering a couple of questions, 
you should be all set. 

If, on the other hand, you would like to stay in control simply check
the following three steps:

1.  An environment variable  \$igmt_root can be set to point to
  the directory where iGMT resides. With  csh this would be done
  by adding a line like
  
	setenv igmt_root $HOME/tcltk/igmt_dir/

  to the  $HOME/.login file. For  ksh you would add
  
	export igmt_root=$HOME/tcltk/igmt_dir/

  to the  .profile file. Alternatively, you will have to modify the 
  main iGMT script (startup script file)  igmt and change line 39
  to point to the root directory.

2. The  igmt script calls the Tcl/Tk shell  wish using the
  explicit call to  /usr/bin/wish in line 75. If  wish is
  somewhere else on your system (try typing  which wish or 
    type which), either change the corresponding line in  igmt or
  set the another environment variable  $wish_cmd. After verifying the
  settings,  igmt should be executable and iGMT can be started by
  typing  $igmt_root/igmt at the command line. (Of course this
  can be facilitated by adding an alias or linking 
    $igmt_root/igmt to some place where your shell looks for
  executables.)

3.  NEW: iGMT needs to know where the GMT binaries are located. In a similar 
fashion as above for  wish, find out where that is (say, in  /usr/local/bin) 
and add a line like

 set gmtbins /usr/local/bin

to your  igmt_siteconfig.tcl file that holds all the necessary modifications
to get iGMT running in your environment.
