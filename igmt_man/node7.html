<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Usage of iGMT</A>
</H1>

<P>
In the following we assume that you have a running version of
iGMT. The usage will be explained by going through all menu points
that show up at the start-up screen. The basic idea of iGMT is to
use GUI facilities to select important plotting parameters, produce a GMT
script and run it from within the program. When this is done successfully,
the produced postscript code is converted to a GIF image and then
displayed. By doing this, it is easy to create a basic script that can
then be modified for more complex applications when the limits of
iGMT are reached.

<P>
The menu list is divided into six pull down menues, <TT>File/Plot</TT>, <TT>  Datasets</TT>, <TT>Data parameters</TT>, <TT>Map parameters</TT>,<TT>Scripting Options</TT> and <TT>GMT man
  pages</TT> as well as two buttons, <TT>Map it!</TT> and <TT>Quit</TT>.<A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot214"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00071000000000000000">
Menu <TT>File</TT></A>
</H2>
This menue takes care of the main file handling and general
input/output functions of iGMT. The
first item, <TT>Create PS ...</TT>, leads to the identical action as
the <TT>Map it!</TT> button, that is:

<UL>
<LI>a GMT script is created and executed;
</LI>
<LI>if a postscript file was created, this is converted into a GIF;
</LI>
<LI>the GIF map display underneath the menu bar is updated.
</LI>
</UL>
The next three items allow the user to create a
postscript file only or individually display the postscript. This
might be helpful if you have trouble installing a PS-to-GIF converter.
The filenames used for this process default to <TT>/tmp/igmt_$USER_tmp.ps</TT> and <TT>/tmp/igmt_$USER_tmp.gif</TT>
(again, this can be changed in <TT>igmt_configure.tcl</TT> or <TT>  igmt_siteconfig.tcl</TT>). ``<TT>$USER</TT>'' is replaced by the UNIX
user name to avoid conflicts with write permissions if more than one
user operates iGMT on a single machine. If the
produced map files are to be kept, the user can either copy them to 
another place by hand or use the following two items in the menu list,
<TT>Save PS file</TT> and <TT>Save GIF file</TT>. 

<P>
<TT>Load </TT> and <TT>Save</TT> <TT>parameters</TT> use a file to dump or restore almost all
iGMT parameter settings so that a session can be restarted at a
later time without having to redo all the fine tuning. iGMT comes
with four example parameter files (<TT>example?.dat</TT>) that can be
loaded to experiment with the software.
<TT>Parameter Format</TT> allows the user to select which version of the iGMT parameter
files should be loaded and written to allow backward compatibility down to iGMT1.0.
<TT>Display manual</TT> displays this manual with the postscript software if installed and
<TT>About iGMT</TT> shows a short description of the software.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00072000000000000000"></A><A NAME="datasetsmenu"></A>
<BR>
Menu <TT>Datasets</TT>
</H2>

<P>
The first item in the <TT>Datasets</TT> menu 
leads to the raster data choice dialog where the files to choose from
are those described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#datasets">5</A>. The same
holds true for the polygon datasets of the second item. In contrast to the raster data
sets, polygon sets can be plotted on top of each other. Future versions
of iGMT will allow multiple layers of raster data as well.

<P>
The next part of the <TT>Datasets</TT> menu allows the user to choose the
custom GMT grd-file he wants to plot, whereas <TT>Change ...</TT> <TT>file</TT> in the next
six lines modify the respective custom polygon data files.

<P>
The polygon menu comes with the option of plotting two user defined
data sets as mentioned above. The following two items in the menu list
bring up two identical dialogs where the names of the custom <TT>xys</TT> files, the
columns for latitude, longitude and size as well as a magnification factors for the size
can be specified. Internally, all data sets are of course handled by a
trivial <TT>awk</TT> script that can be viewed in the GMT script file or 
in the source code, that is <TT>igmt_plotting.tcl</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00073000000000000000">
Menu <TT>Data parameters</TT></A>
</H2>
This and the next menu are used to set all the parameters for the data
and mapping part of the GMT script. 

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00073010000000000000">
Items for <TT>pscoast</TT></A>
</H4>

<P>
The next three items deal with pscoast. A small subset of the polygon
data that can be plotted by this routine are mentioned in the 
<TT>Pscoast</TT>  <TT>polygon</TT>  <TT>selection</TT> list.  The next item allows changing the color of the 
land and sea coverage, while the last pscoast item is responsible for changing some
linewidths.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00073020000000000000">
Raster data set items</A>
</H4>
Toggle the automatically provided legends for the gravity, age, geoid and 
topography data sets on and off and select the subset grid resolution. If the value you
choose (in arc minutes) is smaller than the minimum value supported by
the specific data set, iGMT increases the value again. There will be
a warning when a larger number of data points are about to be processed. Keep
in mind that small machines might have a hard time if the resolution
is too high and/or the map size is too big. 

<P>
``Change colormap'' lets the user choose a colormap other than the
ones used automatically when a predefined raster data file is
selected. If you change the raster data set to one of the predefined
ones after choosing your own colormap, you have to reenter the
selection.  

<P>
``Create colormap'' uses the GMT tool <TT>grd2cpt</TT> to
automatically create a colormap for the default grd-file that is set.
For GMT versions higher than 3.2, the user can select from different colormap
schemes (see the man page for <TT>grd2cpt</TT>), otherwise it's
``rainbow''. Since the colormap is based on a histogram of the
grd-file, colormap creation might take a while with slow machines
and/or large datasets. 

<P>
Use ``Shade raster data'' to
toggle the shading that is done for topographic and gravity datasets
using <TT>grdgradient</TT>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00073030000000000000">
Polygon data set items</A>
</H4>
The next three menu items change roughly what they say, <TT>Symbols...</TT>, <TT>Sizes...</TT> and
<TT>Color</TT> of the polygon data. Sizes are in fractions of the mapwidth and get multiplied
by another factor with the size column of the <TT>xys</TT> data.
The symbols types that are implemented are, again, only a subset of what GMT can do.<A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot442"><SUP>10</SUP></A>Linewidth changing only works for the plate
boundaries, slab contours, velocity vectors 
and the rivers and national boundaries of pscoast so far. 
Name tags can be switched on and off for hot-spots and volcano data sets with the
next item whereas the following, ``Velocity vector parameters'' is used to adjust the 
parameters for the GPS/psvelomeca vectors, WSM parameters can be used to select the 
plotting type for stress data, the minimum quality and the types (<A
 HREF="node10.html#muellerb97">Mueller et&nbsp;al., 1997</A>). Finally,
``City type'' selects between the full and the restricted city data set.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00074000000000000000">
Menu <TT>Map parameters</TT></A>
</H2>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00074010000000000000">
Item <TT>Region</TT></A>
</H4>
This item brings up the region selection dialog. Where the eastern,
northern etc. boundaries are self-explaining, the ``Center of map
projection'' is needed for whole earth viewing projections. Clicking
on ``The whole thing!'' expands the geographical boundaries as far as
possible for the checked projection. ````Square'' it'' attempts to make
a square-like map by setting the difference between the boundaries
equal. ``Center focus in region'' sets the center of map projection
values to the averages of the boundaries.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00074020000000000000">
Item <TT>Projection</TT></A>
</H4>
The projection order chosen for the dialog box follows the GMT manual
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
URL: <TT>http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gmt/gmt_doc.html</TT></DIV>

<BR>
closely. Projections themselves are explained briefly in the <TT>pscoast</TT> man page. The last
check-box, ``custom projection'', allows the user to specify the
projection with the magnification factor in the GMT format
explicitly. This might be needed since formatting is not perfectly
done by iGMT and not all GMT projections are implemented. 
Some of the projections adjust the geographic region to be plotted as suitable.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00074030000000000000">
Items for map grid line and frames</A>
</H4>
<TT>Grid lines</TT> and <TT>Frame</TT>  <TT>annotation</TT> are on/off switches.
By default, the gridlines are twice as densely spaced as the outer
annotation intervals along the map frame. Change this in <TT>  igmt_plotting.tcl</TT>, if you like. The mapscale the user can switch on and off
is positioned in the lower left corner of the map and calculated to be correct at center
latitudes.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00074040000000000000">
Miscellaneous plotting items</A>
</H4>
Add a title to the plot and change the page size and orientation
here. The offsets in <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$x$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$y$"> direction default to one inch each, which is
usually ok. Don't expect perfect results in terms of title placement or
centering of the final map on the produced postscript file, though. Reasonable
results should be achievable with the built in functions of iGMT, while
final copies will probably need some hands-on modification of the GMT script. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00075000000000000000">
Menu <TT>Script</TT></A>
</H2>

<P>
The first item, <TT>Show</TT> <TT>GMT</TT>  <TT>script</TT>, shows the file that is created
and executed by iGMT to get GMT to produce the postscript file we
are viewing. This is intended to do two things: Show the inexperienced
user what can be done (in addition to the introduction in
the GMT manual) and give the experienced user a fast tool to get to a
start script for more complicated applications. This file is called 
<TT>$HOME/igmt_parameters.dat</TT> by default. <TT>Add stuff to the
  pscoast line</TT> lets the user add additional commands to the last <TT>  pscoast</TT> command of the script file without having to exit from
iGMT and run the script independently. The file  presented by <TT>  Show script errors</TT> contains the stderr output of the GMT commands
invoked and should be helpful for debugging. By default, GMT is
``verbose''. 
<TT>GMT version</TT> lets the user change between the old 
GMT version 3.0 and one of the newer versions, such as 3.3. 
The last item of this menu
lets the user switch the GMT logo on and off. By default, it is
off since it would interfere with the colorbars.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00076000000000000000">
Menu <TT>GMT help</TT></A>
</H2>
This menu list is intended to provide fast access to the GMT man
pages for reference. At the time of the first call, a temporary file
is created from the <TT>man</TT> command and afterwards displayed every
time the user selects the same command man page again. If the GMT man pages
are not in the usual place where the <TT>man</TT> command looks for them, 
uncomment the line 

<P>
Finally, the two buttons on the right hand side of the menu bar do what they say.
