Datasets handled by iGMT
</H1>

<P>
While iGMT is lacking the database query functions of full blown GIS
systems it is capable of combining multiple geoscientific data sets
and handling large amounts of data in an efficient way. (Indeed, this
is an achievement of the GMT software and iGMT's approach does not
constrain this feature.) Excellent data is available on the web these
days and iGMT is based upon these publicly available collections.
Since GMT has grown into a <EM>de-facto</EM> standard in parts of the
geophysical community, it seems natural to use GMT to handle the data.

<P>
With the requirements that are explained in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#req">3</A> 
you should now be able to interactively
use the GMT command <TT>pscoast</TT> that is used for plotting maps of
land and sea coverage with political boundaries etc. <A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot428"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
<P>
If you want to take advantage of the built-in handling capabilities 
for various datasets, you need to get the data or tell iGMT where it
can find it if the data is already around on your system. All path
names can be changed together with all other global variables in the
<TT>igmt_configure.tcl</TT> or a site specific <TT>  igmt_siteconfig.tcl</TT> file (see sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#install">4</A>).  
Furthermore, the user has
the option to specify one raster grd-file and two custom polygon data sets.
The <TT>igmt_configure.tcl</TT> is commented so it should be easy to find what
you are looking for. In addition, some of the datasets
require special converting software. We have put some links to datasets on our webpage for
your convenience.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">
Raster data</A>
</H2>

<P>
Besides <TT>pscoast</TT> land and sea coverage and shorelines, 
the following raster data files are supported:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ETOPO5 topography:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The ETOPO5 topography/bathymetry 
(<A
 HREF="node10.html#etopo5">NOAA, 1988</A>, available at <TT>http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/</TT>)
is supported in combination with the <TT>grdraster</TT> tool which is (as <TT>psvelomeca</TT>)
part of the supplementary package that is
available together with the GMT main distribution. The ETOPO5 data set
is about 19MB in i2 binary format.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>``GTOPO30'' topography:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The GTOPO30 DEM model (<A
 HREF="node10.html#gtopo30">EDC, 1996</A>) was greatly expanded
  by <A
 HREF="node10.html#smith97">Smith and Sandwell (1997)</A>. It is supported in the form suggested by Smith &amp;
  Sandwell using <TT>img2latlongrd</TT>. <A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot429"><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
  Data and other tools can be found at
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://topex.ucsd.edu/marine_topo/mar_topo.html</TT>.</DIV>

<BR>
The img format file is 137MB.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Sea-floor age:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The sea-floor age data of  <A
 HREF="node10.html#mueller97">M&#252;ller et&nbsp;al. (1997)</A> was
  published as a GMT <TT>grdfile</TT> and is used in the form as
  available at
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://Omphacite.es.su.oz.au/StaffProfiles/dietmar/Agegrid/agegrid.html</TT>.</DIV>

<BR>
The data is about 23MB in grd format and roughly 10MB in i2 binary
  which could be read by <TT>grdraster</TT> as ETOPO5 (to do this, change
  the corresponding lines in <TT>igmt_plotting.tcl</TT>). By default, iGMT expects the global, grid-file version
  (age data version 1.5).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Free-air gravity:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Sea-floor gravity anomalies as published by
  <A
 HREF="node10.html#sandwell97">Sandwell and Smith (1997)</A> are used as a <TT>grdfile</TT> as found at
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://topex.ucsd.edu/marine_grav/mar_grav.html</TT>.</DIV>

<BR>
As GTOPO30, this file is 137MB big.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Geoid:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>iGMT supports plotting the geoid and comes with an adequate colormap. 
  As an example, we evalutated the spherical harmonic coefficients of the EGM360 model of 
  <A NAME="tex2html161"
  HREF="node10.html#rapp96">Rapp et&nbsp;al. (1996</A>,<A NAME="tex2html162"
  HREF="node10.html#rapp91">1991)</A> from order 2 to 360, corrected for the
  hydrostatic shape of the Earth (<A
 HREF="node10.html#nakiboglu82">Nakiboglu, 1982</A>),
  and included them in quarter arc minute resolution
  as a GMT grd-file in our raster data set. Alternatively, we also offer
  the OSU91A model of <A
 HREF="node10.html#rapp91">Rapp et&nbsp;al. (1991)</A> as a ``typical'' geoid
  representation grd-file. You can download both files from our website.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Global free-air gravity:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Derived from the EGM360 model of 
  <A NAME="tex2html163"
  HREF="node10.html#rapp96">Rapp et&nbsp;al. (1996</A>,<A NAME="tex2html164"
  HREF="node10.html#rapp91">1991)</A> from order 2 to 360, 
  and included in quarter arc minute resolution as a GMT grd-file in our raster data set. 
  Obtained from the file above by multiplying the spherical harmonic
  coefficients by <IMG

<P>
You can download this file from our website.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Sediment thickness:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Sediment thickness is important for seismological studies and
  the comparison between halfspace cooling model prediction and bathymetry. We have included a 
  data handling routines for the <A
 HREF="node10.html#laske97">Laske and Masters (1997)</A> dataset. The data itself is availbale as a <TT>grd</TT>-file
  on our website.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Custom data:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>You can choose an arbitrary GMT grd file to be
  plotted as the base data layer and provide your own colormap, too.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00062000000000000000">
Polygon data</A>
</H2>

<P>
Some example handling procedures for polygon data are included as well:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Plate boundary data:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The plate boundaries as given by
  <A
 HREF="node10.html#demets90">DeMets et&nbsp;al. (1990)</A> are part of the iGMT distribution as the file <TT>    nuvel.yx</TT> in a slightly modified form. Any polygon data file
  supported by <TT>psxy</TT> can be
  substituted for this data set.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Hotspot locations:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>iGMT uses a list of hotspots compiled by <A
 HREF="node10.html#steinberger98b">Steinberger (1998)</A> 
  to plot their location and a name tag, if selected.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Volcano locations:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program's list of volcanoes 
  (<A
 HREF="node10.html#simkin94">Simkin and Siebert, 1994</A>) is supported
  in the form found at
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://www.volcano.si.edu/gvp/volcdata/index.htm</TT>.</DIV>

<BR>
As for the hotspot data, the user can select a symbol, the color and toggle a
  name tag. A version of this list as of April 1998 is included. If
  you want to install an update, just download the data from the web
  and replace the adequate file. The same holds true for the
  earthquake catalogs since iGMT was programmed to handle the original data.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CMT fault plane solutions:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>iGMT uses <TT>psvelomeca</TT> from
  the GMT supplements package to plot the double couple part of the Harvard CMT 
  centroid moment tensor solutions (e.g. <A
 HREF="node10.html#cmtreview">Dziewonski and Woodhouse, 1983</A>) as found at
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://www.seismology.harvard.edu/CMTsearch.html</TT>.</DIV>

<BR>
A list of all events in the catalog of the first 60 days of 1998 is included
  as an example.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Significant earthquakes:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A
 HREF="node10.html#ngdc_sig">Dunbar et&nbsp;al. (1997)</A> have compiled a list
  of significant earthquakes starting 2000 B.C., their catalog is accesible at
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/sigintro.html</TT>.</DIV>

<BR>
After
  quoting all lines without data by inserting a hash sign ("# "),
  the format produced by this engine  can be read directly into
  iGMT. (Internally, all that iGMT does is to use awk to check if
  lines are quoted and for exporting of the relevant columns.) iGMT
  plots only earthquakes that have a magnitude assigned, you might
  want to change the relevant <TT>awk</TT> lines in <TT>igmt_plotting.tcl</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>PDE earthquakes:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The United States Geological Survey keeps
  different hypocenter catalogs at the National Earthquake Information
  Center
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
URL: <TT>http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/epic/epic_global.html</TT>).</DIV>

<BR>
The ``Screen File Format'' can be read by iGMT.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Slab contours:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><A
 HREF="node10.html#gudmundsson98">Gudmundsson and Sambridge (1998)</A> define 
contours of the upper edge of subducting slabs from the relocated hypocenters of 
<A
 HREF="node10.html#engdahl98">Engdahl et&nbsp;al. (1998)</A>. 
These seismicity contours are available from
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://rses.anu.edu.au/seismology/projects/RUM/rum_download.html</TT>,</DIV>

<BR>
we have included them in a format readable by GMT.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Velocity vectors:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Simon McClusky provided a routine that handles 
  velocity solution plotting using <TT>psvelomeca</TT>. A typical application would
  be the mapping of results from GPS studies such as the <TT>gps.vel</TT> global data example
  we have included.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>World Stress Map:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The World Stress Map Project
  (e.g., <A
 HREF="node10.html#zoback92">Zoback, 1992</A>) compiles stress measurements all over the
  world. We supply a routine that can read the WSM's ASCII format data
  base (<A
 HREF="node10.html#muellerb97">Mueller et&nbsp;al., 1997</A>). It plots either only the compressive
  directions of the horizontal stress regime (as it is commonly done),
  or different style vector pairs on basis of the focal mechanism
  classification for the horizontal plane projection. The different
  vector style plots two equal length vectors (one compressional, one
  extensional) if the focal mechanism is labelled ``strike-slip'', one
  compressional (extensional) vector if the focal mechanism is purely
  compressional (extensional), and it uses one half-length and one
  full length vector for compressional or extensional mechanisms with
  a strike-slip component in the horizontal plane.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Major cities:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>We have supplied a (rather inaccurate) data set
  of 726 cities with their names and locations.  This data set can be
  restricted to the major 235 cities. The corresponding data sets are
  <TT>wcity.dat</TT> and <TT>wcity_major.dat</TT> (the latter is a subset
  of the full data set).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Custom ``xys'' files:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>iGMT can plot two custom ASCII data files
  specified by the user.  They have to be in a columnar ASCII format
  (separator is a white space or tab, comment lines can be introduced
  by a number sign, ``#''), similar to the polygon data described
  above, and need at least longitude and latitude in every line. Size
  values can be given optionally, hence ``xys''.  (For instance, for
  earthquakes hypocentres you would give longitude, latitude, and
  magnitude. The magnitude will be used to scale each symbol that is
  plotted on your map. To change all symbol sizes in an absolute
  sense, you can choose <TT>sizes polygon data</TT> in the <TT>Data
    parameters</TT> menu.  When you use polygon drawing by choosing
  ``line'' as a symbol in <TT>Symbols polygon data</TT> for your polygon
  file, the <TT>sizes polygon data</TT> item will change the width of the
  line.) 

<P>
You can interactively choose the column numbers (ie., use the eight
  and ninth column instead of the first and second) which hold the x
  and y values, if you leave the column number for size blank,
  xy-plotting is assummed. The magnification factor is a
  pre-multiplier for the size entry that is later modified by the
  standard size of the symbols (see also section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#datasetsmenu">6.2</A>).

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Technical details how these files are handled are explained later in
the text and in the comments found in <TT>igmt_plotting.tcl</TT>.
