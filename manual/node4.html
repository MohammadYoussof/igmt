Software requirements
</H1>

<P>
The current version of iGMT is intended for use on UNIX
systems<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot447"><SUP>4</SUP></A>  and was developed running IRIX 6.3-6.5.
However, it should be easily modified to run on other hardware
platforms without much effort since all the software that iGMT relies
on or an equivalent is available for most operating systems. This is
especially the case for Macs and PCs whereas we have no experience
with the ported programs.  <A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot31"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
<P>
The iGMT script package that comes with this documentation, some
example plots and small datasets are available at the iGMT home page
<BR>
<P>
<TT>http://www.seismology.harvard.edu/<IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="53" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">becker/igmt/</TT>
<BR>
<P>
These website are also the places to check for updates, bug reports
etc. iGMT assumes that you have the following software installed and
accessible either via the user's <TT>$path</TT> variable or the binary
paths set in <TT>igmt_configure.tcl</TT> or the <TT>igmt_siteconfig.tcl</TT> file (see sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#install">4</A>). This software
requirement should be automatically fulfilled if you are running a
LINUX system from any of the major distribution, e.g. Redhat 7.1. If
any of this does not make sense to you, please ask your system
administrator.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Tcl/Tk:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>iGMT is mostly written in Tcl/Tk, a
  convenient language for constructing graphical user interfaces.

<P>
The Tcl script language and the Tk toolkit (<A
 HREF="node30.html#ousterhout">Ousterhout, 1993</A>) are
  currently available at
  <TT>http://www.tcltk.com/</TT> or <TT>    http://dev.ajubasolutions.com/</TT>. Version 8.0 of Tcl/Tk was used for
  developing, older versions may work as well. From the newer releases,
  we found that 8.2.1 gave problems while 8.3 seems to work fine.
  Tcl is available for UNIX, PC, Mac and other platforms.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>GMT:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The generic mapping tools (<A NAME="tex2html149"
  HREF="node30.html#wessel98">Wessel and Smith, 1998</A>,<A NAME="tex2html150"
  HREF="node30.html#wessel95">1995</A>,<A NAME="tex2html151"
  HREF="node30.html#gmt">1991</A>) do the
  mapping part, they are called by a script file produced from within iGMT. 
  The source code distribution of GMT as well as documentation
  is available at
<BR>  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TT>http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gmt.html</TT>.</DIV>

<BR>
GMT itself has
  some additional software requirements, such as the availability of the netcdf library
  (see the GMT documentation). 

<P>
iGMT is now set for GMT version 3.4.x by default.  If you are running
  an older version (3.<IMG
 WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="53" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$x$">, where at the moment <IMG
 WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="66" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$x=0,$"> 1, 2, 3) change
  the <TT>gmt_version</TT> variable in iGMT (see sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#install">4</A>).
  For <IMG
 WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="66" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$x&gt;0$">, you will furthermore have to make sure that the
  environment <TT>$GMTHOME</TT> variable is set and accessible by your
  batch-shell (<TT>ksh</TT> by default).  You can set different binary
  paths depending on the version of GMT you are running. iGMT switches
  between them if the user changes GMT versions during runtime.

<P>
We have included the option to change the binary directories
  according to the GMT version that is selected. To modify these
  optional directories, set the iGMT variables <TT>    higher_version_gmtbins</TT> and <TT>lower_version_gmtbins</TT> (see
  sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#install">4</A>).

<P>
A particular problem that arose for GMT versions larger than 3.0 is
  the changed Postscript handling. To achieve nice conversions from
  GMT-Postscript output, the new <TT>.gmtdefaults</TT> file has to
  include ``A4+'' as <TT>PAPER_MEDIA</TT>. iGMT handles this by copying
  its preferred version of GMT parameter settings into the working
  directory at the beginning of a session. If the GMT version is then
  changed during a session, the different <TT>.gmtdefaults</TT> version
  of 3.0 and 3.4, say, might confuse the GMT commands and output may
  fail. It is therefore best to keep the GMT version constant during
  an iGMT run.

<P>
Also see our comments on
<BR>
<P>
<TT>http://op.gfz-potsdam.de/igmt/gmt_versions.html</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>gawk:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The <TT>awk</TT> command family (<TT>awk</TT> itself, the
  math-included version <TT>nawk</TT>, and usually the GNU-version <TT>    gawk</TT>) is available on all UNIX systems such as AIX, IRIX,
  SOLARIS, HPUX or LINUX. AWK or some GNU flavors of it such as <TT>    gawk</TT>, which is used by iGMT per default,  runs also on PCs and
  Macs. (To change the default <TT>awk</TT>-type binary, modify the iGMT
  variable <TT>our_awk</TT> (see sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#install">4</A>).  If <TT>gawk</TT> is
  not available, use
  <TT>nawk</TT> instead of simple <TT>awk</TT> since our scripts might
  rely on math functions which might or might not be accessible from
  within <TT>awk</TT>.)

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ghostview:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>iGMT uses the GNU software <TT>ghostview</TT> as a
  postscript display program.  A possible postscript viewer
  alternative would be <TT>showps</TT> or <TT>ghostscript</TT>, available
  for PC and Mac (change iGMT variable <TT>psviewer</TT> (see
  sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#install">4</A>)).  iGMT works fine without any postscript
  displayer at all as long as you do not need to view the PS files
  that GMT produces before printing them.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>convert:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The <TT>convert</TT> tool of the ImageMagick software
<BR>
<P>
<TT>http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html</TT>
<BR>
<P>
is used to convert from PS to the GIF format so that GMT output can
  be judged right away. (iGMT variable <TT>ps_to_gif_converter</TT>
  (see sec.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#install">4</A>).)

<P>
You might as well use <TT>ghostscript</TT> to convert from postscript
  or change the graphic format that is used for previewing to
  something completely different. <A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot449"><SUP>6</SUP></A>  iGMT works fine without a converting
  tool even though you might get an error message when you use ``Map
  it!''.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
If you have installed the tools mentioned above you should be ready to
use the basic version of iGMT. While the requirements above might seem
complicated, it should be kept in mind that nowadays most UNIX or
LINUX systems come with all of the above except GMT when the system
software is installed. GMT, on the other hand, is widely in use in the
earth sciences already. In addition, all of the software needed to run
iGMT is freeware or shareware of some kind and most of it is subjected
to an open developing policy.
